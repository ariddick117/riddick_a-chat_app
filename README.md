# Socket.IO ChatApp

Use Node, Express and Vue with socket.io to create an interactive chat application. Design an engaging skin for the application using HTML / CSS (and SASS); add transitions / interesting micro transactions using a combination of JS and CSS (you can use something like Greensock).
Use Vue.js on the front end. You can use components if you like, or keep the build more basic and just bind data to the view(s).
Expand on the default functionality / class build. You could add a login page / user registration, include a notification message when a user joins or leaves the chat, and use colour to differentiate between user messages.
Choose at least one other enhancement - NOT including whatâ€™s already in the class build - to implement

## Description

- Multiple users can join a chat room by each entering a unique username
on website load.
- Users can type chat messages to the chat room.
- A notification is sent to all users when a user joins or leaves
the chatroom.
